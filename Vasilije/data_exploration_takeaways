--- DATA EXPLORATION TAKEOVERS ---
----------------------------------


1. There are 31072 samples in the training dataset, each containing 4 images that represents one color filter (red,
   green, blue or yellow)

2. Given train dataset is quite imbalanced. Most common protein structures that occurs in the training set are:
    * Nucleoplasm (12885)
    * Cytosol (8228)
    * Plasma membrane (3777)
    * Nucleoli (3261)
   Protein structure that occurs the least in the training set are:
    * Rods & rings (11)
    * Microtubule ends (21)
    * Lysosomes (28)
    * Endosomes (45)
    * Peroxisomes (53)
   Due to imbalance training set, it will be hard to accurately predict those minor labels and targets and we will need
   to find some way to deal with this

3. Most images have 1 or 2 label in a Target column, only two have 5 labels classified and that is the maximum

4. About the correlation among the labels, many labels have some slight correlation with others. The biggest correlation
   is between Endosomes and Lysosomes, while the second biggest correlation is between Mitotic spindle and Cytokinetic
   bridge.
